# Yuzu doesn't launch when i try to start to host

Currently a bug. Yuzu (randomly ?) sometimes crash at startup. It need some investigation but you can just re try and it should work

# I joined a game but it launched my favorite browser and the game is displayed in a tab

You forgot to launch the Parsec desktop app. Parsec will try to launch it first throught the desktop app and if it can't, it will fallback to the browser version of parsec. While it work, the best performance are achieved throught the desktop app. Just be sure it launched before trying to join a game

# When i successfully join a game,the input from my controller is not working

- Is delfinovin launched and working ?
- You also need to focus the parsec desktop app for your input to be sent, so be aware when you alt+tab or do other things, be sure to focus back to the app
- if none of the above is working, ask the host (throught the lobby chat) to check the settings of the Controller 2 of his yuzu. He have to quit fullscreen (by pressing f11) , go to the control settings and check if

  Controller 2 is enabled

  GameCube controller 2 is selected

  And retry to input something

# When i successfully join a game and i try to enter my tag in the game for my custom input, i don't see anything

Normal, right now only the in game screen is being streamed to you, so you are not seiing the switch editor when it's appear. Ask the host to enter your tag and after that you should be able to continue
